  <h2>History of FIFA WORLD CUP</h2>
  <p>The FIFA World Cup known as Fedration International de Football Association was first held in 1930, when FIFA, the world's football governing body, decided to stage an international men’s football tournament under the era of FIFA president Jules Rimet
    who put this idea into place. The inaugural edition, held in 1930, was contested as a final tournament of only thirteen teams invited by the organization. Since then, the World Cup has experienced successive expansions and format remodeling, with
    its current 32-team final tournament preceded by a two-year qualifying process, involving over 200 teams from around the world.In 1930, FIFA made the decision to stage their own international tournament. The 1932 Summer Olympics, held in Los Angeles,
    did not plan to include football as part of the programme due to the low popularity of the sport in the United States. FIFA and the IOC also disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the Games.[8] FIFA president
    Jules Rimet thus set about organizing the inaugural World Cup tournament. With Uruguay now two-time official world champions and due to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country. The national associations
    of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides. No European country pledged to send a team until two months before
    the start of the competition.[citation needed] Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia to make the trip.[9] In total, 13 nations took part – seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North
    America.</p>
  <p>FIFA is an abbreviation, it stands for Fédération Internationale de Football Association which means International Federation of Association Football in English. It was founded in 1904 and the headquarters operate from Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
  <p>FIFA is an organisation that is very well known around the world as it is the governing body of football, beach soccer and futsal and has more than 200 member countries from different parts of the world.</p>
  <p>FIFA is in charge of organising and advertising many international tournaments such as the World Cup and the Women’s World Cup.</p>
